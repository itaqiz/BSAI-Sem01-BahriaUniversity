\section{Font Styles and Sizes}

This is a simple example demonstrating different font styles and sizes in LaTeX.

\textbf{Bold text} is used to emphasize important points.

\textit{Italic text} is suitable for citations or quotations.

\texttt{Typewriter text} is often used for code listings.

\subsection{Font Sizes}

We can set different font sizes using the `\fontsize` command:

\fontsize{12pt}{14pt}\selectfont This is 12pt font with 14pt line spacing.
\fontsize{18pt}{20pt}\selectfont This is 18pt font with 20pt line spacing.

\subsection{Font Switches}

To change the font style from a certain point to the end of the document, we can use the `\rmfamily`, `\bfseries`, `\itshape`, and `\ttfamily` switches:

\rmfamily This is normal Roman text.
\bfseries This is bold text.
\itshape This is italic text.
\ttfamily This is typewriter text.
