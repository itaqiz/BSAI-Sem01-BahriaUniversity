    <h1>What type of mobile phone you have and why do you like it or not?</h1>
    <h3>I have Huawei Phone.</h3> 
    <p>I like it because it has many features and also it is cheaper. It has a good videography camera with an aperture of F/4 that captures wide depth of field. I love the ability to check in on the people that I love without having to make phone calls.</p>
